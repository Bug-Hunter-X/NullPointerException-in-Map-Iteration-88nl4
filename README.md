# Groovy NullPointerException in Map Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common Groovy error related to handling null values when iterating over Maps.  The `bug.groovy` file contains code that throws a `NullPointerException` when a null Map is passed to a method.

The solution, located in `bugSolution.groovy`, provides a robust approach to handle potential null values gracefully.
